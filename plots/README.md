# Elizabeth McMurchie R Assignment Plots
This directory contains my plots for the BCB 546 R assignment

## Contents of this directory
This directory contains: 

- `SNP_figure.pdf` and `SNP_figure.png`: Figures depicting SNP position distribution across all 10 maize and 10 teosinte chromosomes using a histogram. 
- `SNP_pos_bar.pdf` and `SNP_pos_bar.png`: Figures depicting number of SNP positions on each of the 10 chromosomes for maize and teosinte.
- `SNP_pos_total.pdf` and `SNP_pos_total.png`: Figures depicting total number of SNP positions for maize and teosinte.
- `SNP_figure_point.pdf` and `SNP_figure_point.png`: Figures depicting SNP position distribution across all 10 maize and 10 teosinte chromosomes with `geom_point`.
- `zygo_species_plot.pdf` and `zygo_species_plot.png`: Figures depicting proportion of homozygous and heterozygous sites, as well as missing data, for maize and teosinte.
- `zygo_group_plot.pdf` and `zygo_group_plot.png`: Figures depicting proportion of homozygous and heterozygous sites, as well as missing data, for each sampling group for maize and teosinte.
- `zygo_sample_plot.pdf` and `zygo_sample_plot.png`: Figures depicting proportion of homozygous and heterozygous sites, as well as missing data, for every maize and teosinte sample ID.
- `gc_group_plot.pdf` and `gc_group_plot.png`: Figures depicting amount of G/G, C/C, C/G. and G/C positions (positions where it was certain that there was a G or C) for each sampling group for maize and teosinte.
- `gc_species_plot.pdf` and `gc_species_plot.png`: amount of G/G, C/C, C/G. and G/C positions (positions where it was certain that there was a G or C) for both species (maize and teosinte)
